# ðŸ”§ YCB Converter
This repository provides tools to convert [YCB (Yale-Carnegie Mellon-Berkeley) Objects](https://www.ycbbenchmarks.com/) into formats usable in rigid body physics simulation.
Running the main script will download YCB models and convert them to simulation-ready URDF models (and optionally to USD if a path to Isaac Orbit is set):
```bash
python ycb_converter/main.py --orbit-path /path/to/orbit
```


## Requirements
- [`coacd`](https://github.com/SarahWeiii/CoACD) -  for convex decomposition
- [`trimesh`](https://trimesh.org/) - for mesh manipulation
- [`yourdfpy`](https://yourdfpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - for URDF generation
- ([`orbit`](https://isaac-orbit.github.io/)-  for USD conversion)

Required dependencies (except for Isaac ORBIT) can be installed via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
To install ORBIT, follow the instructions on the [official website](https://isaac-orbit.github.io/).

## Features
To understand and inspect the different stages of the conversion process, go to the [Quickstart Notebook](./notebooks/quickstart.ipynb).

The object weights in [`data/weights.json`](./data/weights.json) were determined using a scale for all objects for which there are laser scans.
